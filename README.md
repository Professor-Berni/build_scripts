Scripts for building a working LineageOS ROM or TWRP image.

These files should be placed in the corresponding <working_directory>, for example the file "build_los14.sh" should be placed in a directory named los14.

Give the init scripts the execution permission (chmod +x) and execute them, for example by typing:
```
cd <working_directory>
./build_los14.sh
```

This may take a lot of time depending on your computer speed.

Please grab a coffee and relax meanwhile...
